# The Visual Framework for EMBL.org

The Visual Framework (VF) is designed with the needs of life science websites and services. It goes beyond guidance for tables, graphs, data-heavy typography and focuses on sane defaults. It implements CSS in a way that does not interfere with existing components. The VF 2.0 enables consistency and portability, it is extensible, modular and overridable; here to help and not get in the way.

*Eleventy* - a static site generator which transforms a directory of templates (of varying types) into HTML - makes use of the Visual Framework for styling.
