## Need a site

Build it yourself with the guidance below, or contact the Digital Team ([digital-comms@embl.org](mailto:digital-comms@embl.org)).

## 1. CSS, JS to use and its architecture

EMBL uses the [Visual Framework 2.0](https://visual-framework.github.io/vf-welcome/) (VF) as it is designed with the needs of life science websites and services. It goes beyond guidance for tables, graphs, data-heavy typography and focuses on sane defaults. It implements CSS in a way that does not interfere with existing components. The VF 2.0 enables consistency and portability, it is extensible, modular and overridable; here to help and not get in the way.

### Need pre-buit CSS and JS?

If you don't need to indivdually include components, you can use the rollup CSS and JS:

{% codeblock 'html' -%}
<link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="https://dev.assets.emblstatic.net/embl-design-system/develop/css/styles.css" />
<script src="https://dev.assets.emblstatic.net/embl-design-system/develop/scripts/scripts.js"></script>
{% endcodeblock %}

## 2. Templates and themes

## 3. Patterns and boilerplates

Once you've started with a template above follow guidance and copy-paste examples from the EMBL VF Pattern+Component library.

Where components offer technical implementations, patterns and boilerplates show
how things should come together to facilitate tasks and goals.
