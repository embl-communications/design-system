The Visual Framework (VF) is designed with the needs of life science websites and services. It goes beyond guidance for tables, graphs, data-heavy typography and focuses on sane defaults. It implements CSS in a way that does not interfere with existing components. The VF 2.0 enables consistency and portability, it is extensible, modular and overridable; here to help and not get in the way.

### 2. Templates and themes

**React boilerplate**

**Vanilla HTML boilerplates**
