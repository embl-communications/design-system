# EMBL Brand Guidelines

The EMBL brand, with its three core elements - logo, typeface and colour set - is designed to make a memorable impression and signal to people what they can expect from the organisation.

The EMBL Brand is the organisationâ€™s visual identity in print and online.

Designers and writers at EMBL should be informed of the rules and recommendations below for the EMBL brand and use them in their work. They can protect and strengthen the EMBL brand by creating compelling, engaging on-brand content.

The guidelines do not describe good design or user experience - this is [covered extensively elsewhere](https://1stwebdesigner.com/top-10-ux-blogs/) - but rather, they provide an overview of the key branding elements for EMBL and how to use them in context.

For questions, including advice and approvals, contact the Design Team Lead: [design@embl.org](mailto:design@embl.org)

## What is corporate design?

Corporate design is the manner in which an organisation presents itself visually to the public. A good corporate design should readily identify the organisation; differentiate it from other organisations; and provide a coherent design system across all communications channels.  Visual consistency is key - it should not matter whether content is print or digital.

## The EMBL brand: Three core elements

The EMBL brand is made up of three core elements: the EMBL logo, the IBM Plex typeface, and the colour set. You will find a summary of the rules for each at the links below:

- [logo](embl-logo.md)
- [typeface](typeface.md)
- [colour set](colours.md)
