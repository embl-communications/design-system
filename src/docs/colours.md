# The colour set: Overview

Besides logo, typeface and graphical elements, colours are one the most important parts of a corporate design.

The set below shows all the colours for the EMBL brand. Other colours are not allowed. Any kind of colour coding in alignment with a service, group etc. is not allowed. Our main colour is white, in order to underline the bespoke usage of white space in our visual example.
