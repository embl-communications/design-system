# The typeface: Overview
A core element of the EMBL Brand is the typeface IBM Plex. Use it where possible. Two variations should be used:

IBM Plex Sans is used:
- for masterbrand applications
– for all online and offline applications were possible 
- not to be used as display weights for sub brands 
- not to be used for highly inspirational products

IBM Plex Mono is used: 
- only for inspirational communication products
- only as a display weight

For Microsoft Office, use Franklin Gothic (medium for Headlines, book for bodytext) or IBM Plex Sans.
